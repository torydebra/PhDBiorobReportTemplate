%Detail the specific objectives of the current year, and summarize the planned activities of the other two/one years. 

Nowadays, recent advancements in the development of robotic systems have augmented the robot capabilities, making it possible to face complex tasks. Indeed, in always more difficult scenarios, like industry and construction sites, robots can help the workers, relieving them from the most exhausting and dangerous part of their job, for example the manipulation of heavy loads in unstructured environments. 
These advancements put new challenges for the remote command of the robotic system.
The growing complexity of robots and the effective exploitation of their enhanced capabilities can be tackled by the development of novel intuitive human-robot interfaces. 

The objective of this research is indeed to explore and develop new human-robot interfaces that are intuitive and simple, minimizing the operator cognitive and physical workload to learn and to use these interfaces. At the same time, these interfaces must deliver a certain level of robot autonomy, relieving the operator to take care of every minimal aspect of the job. 

Considering these key features, this research project explored new teleoperation paradigms.
One result is the development of the TelePhysicalOperation concept, an innovative teleoperation interface that combines the intuitiveness of a physical human-robot interaction maintaining the safety of controlling the robot from a distance.
The interface has been enriched with robot autonomy features to reduce the operator burden and to improve the performance of the task, in a shared-control fashion. For example, a mobile manipulator can generate arm and mobile base commands from a single input of the operator, relieving her/him to switch between arm and mobile base control. Thanks to another autonomy feature, the robot can bimanually keep the grasp on a transported load while the operator commands only the object velocities, without worrying about the grasping forces necessary to make the object to not fall. 

In general, it is not always straightforward for the operator to be aware about the status of the robot and of the task by visual information only, delivered by a monitor or by directly looking at the robot in the task environment. For this reason, this research explored the importance of tactile feedback during the remote teleoperation. Thus, the TelePhysicalOperation has been improved adding a feedback channel with the development of a customized sensorimotor interface. These devices deliver tactile and vibrational feedback to the user's arms in response to inputs given to the robot and interactions with the robot's environment. This enhancement in the operator's experience was validated through experiments involving novice users.

With the goal of developing interfaces that are easy-to-use, intuitive, and suitable to complex robots, another aspect of the work involves a teleoperation interface based on visual servoing guidance using an inexpensive laser device. With the architecture developed for this purpose, simply by pointing a laser emitter in the environment, the operator is able to command even highly articulated robots effortlessly and efficiently for loco-manipulation tasks. The same interface has also been proved to be adaptable to a different scenario, an assistive one, where users with arm impairments can control a manipulator with the laser worn on the head.    

In conclusion, this research has provided new kinds of interfaces to face the challenge of commanding complex robots but without overwhelming the operator with complicated user interfaces.
