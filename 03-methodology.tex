To improve the current state of the art in telerobotics, the key challenges faced by this research are permitting the control of complex robots with the a minimum efforts from the user, hence developing intuitive interfaces and providing robot autonomy features.
Physical human robot interaction has been considered, in the development of the TelePhysicalOperation interface, which permits to control the robot by applying virtual forces. The robot complies to these virtual forces as if they were real, like in a physical human-robot interaction. The interfaces has been enhanched with shared control techniques to share the control between the operator and the robot itself: for example, while the operator commands only the velocity of the end-effector, the robot generates arm commands and mobile base commands according to the arm manipulability level, letting the end-effector to reach the goal even if it is out of the reaching of the arm. Another example is the autonomous regulation of robot arms grasping forces to keep a carried load, while taking as input just the object velocity commanded by the operator. 
To augment the user-robot interaction haptic solutions has been explored, to let the user perceive other kind of information other than the visual ones. 

In parallel, another kind of interface has been developed: a novel teleoperation interface based on a visual servoing guidance with an inexpensive laser device, which further simplify the user interface, but requesting more robot autonomy which has been addressed with an architecture based on Behaviour Trees~\cite{Iovino2022}. Other than with complex robots, the interface has been evaluated with a simpler fixed manipulator, but showing the potentiality of this interface as an assistive device for impaired arm users.
