To advance the state of the art in telerobotics, this research addressed the key challenges of enabling effortless control of complex robots by developing intuitive interfaces which include robot autonomy features.
In the first period, the TelePhysicalOperation interface has been developed. Later, the interface has been enhanced with some robot autonomy features to \enquote{share the control} between the operator and the robot itself: for example, while the operator commands only the velocity of the end-effector, the robot generates arm commands and mobile base commands according to the arm manipulability level, letting the end-effector to reach the goal even if it is out of the reaching of the arm.
The interface has been further enriched by incorporating a haptic feedback channel, allowing users to perceive information beyond the visual domain. Naive users who evaluated the haptic-enabled TelePhysicalOperation positively endorsed the inclusion of haptic cues.

Concurrently, an alternative teleoperation interface has been developed, utilizing visual servoing guidance with a laser device. The resulting user interface is very easy-to-use and intuitive, permitting to the user to indicate location of interest with an inexpensive device. Nevertheless, this has required more robot autonomy which has been addressed with an architecture based on Behaviour Trees~\cite{Iovino2022}.
Other than with complex robots, the interface has been evaluated with a simpler fixed manipulator, showing the potentiality of this interface as an assistive device for impaired arm users.
